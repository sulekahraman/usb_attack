## Plugging in a USB: What's the Worst That Could Happen?
This repo contains our implementation of a sophisticated HID (Human Interface Device) spoofing attack where the device is a USB stick that tricks the computer into thinking it is a keyboard. When plugged into a computer, it injects keystrokes to open the command line on the computer and allows for various exploits. One exploit we explored is automatically sending important files to the attacker server.
